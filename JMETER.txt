step1:java installation in your local system
step2:search in google jmeter(apachi) download 
step3: unzip downloaded jmeter folder and keep it in your any local drive E or....
step4:start Jmeter
(in windows-jmeter/bin-jmeter.bat (click that jmeter.bat it will start)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test plan- it's like a container,here test all the elements to test(like:thread group,leaserners,...)
WorkBench- here you can keep your elements for temporary basis(workbench is not safe,if you want be safe you can keep in testplan)
 
How to create first jmeter:
step1:start jmeter
step2:create a testplan
step3:create a thread group(users)
step4:add a sampler(http)
step5:add listeners(for view results in table ,or view results tree)
step6:to run the test

---------------------------

Assertion results:
Response assertion
Assertion= to check on the response

-users->Assertions->response assersion(commonly use)
-Response assertion

-----------------------
-Duration Assertion: give a some seconds (2000mili seconds) and check the response is it passed or not ,if
---------
-Size assertion: basically for size(you can give like a =,>=,<=,....something )
-Add->Assertion->size assertion
-------
HTML Assertion
-Add->Assertion->HTML Assertion
at this point you can give error threshold and worning threshold (like error threshold-38, worning threshold-110)
if you want to save some errors you can browse location select .txt file and save it ...so after run you will get all errors
So Jmeter provides us this way to check out XML,HTML and so on
----
XML Assertion
-Add->Assertion->XML Assertion

----
XPath Assertion
-Add->Assertion->XPath Assertion
(this is will mostly be used in API testing so we'll be having a dam on API) 
---------------
Listeners:
Listeners are the elements of jmeter which gather the info about the test
and used to view results/metrics of the test 
-Add->Listeners->view results in table 
-Add->Listeners->view results in tree
-Add->Listeners->Aggregate Report    --------this will give a single line report of listeners elements
-Add->Listeners->graph result                         ----you can check graph result also
